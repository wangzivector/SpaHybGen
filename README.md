# SpaHybGen: Scene-Level Spatial Grasp Generation for General Robotic Hands
## Introduction
Generating grasp poses for general grippers in SE(3) using learning and optimization strategies in clutter scenes. It use the real grasping dataset GraspNet-1Billion to train the inference section. SpaHybGen can directly and robustly deploys any robotic hand with its URDF to actual clutter grasping in minutes, using a single depth camera.
